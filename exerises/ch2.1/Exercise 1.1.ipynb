    "# Kafka CLI Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn how to use the most common Kafka CLI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listing topics\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's see how to list topics that already exist within Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this command, you should see output like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "__confluent.support.metrics\n",
    "__consumer_offsets\n",
    "_confluent-ksql-ksql_service_docker_command_topic\n",
    "_schemas\n",
    "connect-config\n",
    "connect-offset\n",
    "connect-status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--list` switch tells the `kafka-topics` CLI to list all known topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--zookeeper localhost:2181` switch tells the `kafka-topics` CLI where the\n",
    "Zookeeper ensemble Kafka is using is located. Note that in the newest versions of Kafka the\n",
    "`--zookeeper` switch is deprecated in favor of a `--bootstrap-server` switch that points to Kafka. The `--zookeeper` switch still works, but will likely be dropped in the next major revision of Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't created any topics yet, so what you're seeing are system topics that Kafka and other\n",
    "Kafka ecosystem tools make use of.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen what topics exist, let's create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-topics --create --topic \"my-first-topic\" --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --zookeeper localhost:2181`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this command it should silently exit after a few moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The switch `--topic \"my-first-topic\"` tells Kafka what to name the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The switch `--partitions 1` and the switch `--replication-factor 1` are required configuration\n",
    "which we will explore more in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check that our topic was successfully created, let's repeat the command to list topics with a\n",
    "slight modification:\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic \"my-first-topic\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a single topic should be printed, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my-first-topic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Producing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a topic, let's add some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-console-producer --topic \"my-first-topic\" --broker-list PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092`\n",
    "\n",
    "The switch `--broker-list` serves the same purpose as `--zookeeper` for the `kafka-topics` command -- \n",
    "it simply tells the tool where to find Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit enter, you should be dropped into an interactive terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try typing out a few messages and hitting enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root@6b48dc2bd81c:/# kafka-console-producer --topic \"my-first-topic\" --broker-list PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092\n",
    ">hello\n",
    ">world!\n",
    ">my\n",
    ">first\n",
    ">kafka\n",
    ">events!\n",
    ">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consuming data\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's great that we've produced data, it would be more exciting if we could see it being\n",
    "consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new terminal tab and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-console-consumer --topic \"my-first-topic\" --bootstrap-server PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that nothing prints out? Remember that by default Kafka doesn't provide historical messages to new consumers. Return to the producer and enter a few new messages. You should see them come across the screen!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hit `Ctrl+C` to exit the consumer. Let's try this again, but ask Kafka to provide all the messages that have been published to the topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-console-consumer --topic \"my-first-topic\" --bootstrap-server PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 --from-beginning`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--from-beginning` switch tells `kafka-console-consumer` to read data from the beginning of the topic, not just data from when we connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see output that includes all of the messages you've produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root@6b48dc2bd81c:/# kafka-console-consumer --topic \"my-first-topic\" --bootstrap-server PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 --from-beginning\n",
    "hello\n",
    "world!\n",
    "my\n",
    "first\n",
    "kafka\n",
    "events!\n",
    "hello again!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've explored working with the CLI tools, let's clean up our topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-topics --delete --topic \"my-first-topic\" --zookeeper localhost:2181`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is nearly identical to the `--create` command from earlier, except now we're calling the\n",
    "command with the `--delete` switch instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command does not print any output if it's successful. To check that your topic is actually deleted, list the topics one more time:\n",
    "\n",
    "`kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my-first-topic` should no longer appear in the list of topics.\n",
    "\n"
