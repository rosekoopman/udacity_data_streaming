    "KSQL Also allows for the creation of Streams derived from queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE STREAM popular_uris AS\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM clickevents\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, lets see how we can delete a stream.\n",
    "\n",

    "DROP STREAM popular_uris;\n",

    "The following queries read from this source: [].\n",
    "The following queries write into this source: [CSAS_POPULAR_URIS_0].\n",
    "You need to terminate them before dropping POPULAR_URIS.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the covers KSQL is running a query to populate this stream. We first need to\n",
    "terminate that query _before_ we can terminate the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "To terminate the query, we need to know its `query_id`. This can be easily found :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SHOW QUERIES;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now proceed to delete the query and thereafter delete the stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TERMINATE QUERY CSAS_POPULAR_URIS_0;\n",
    "DROP STREAM popular_uris;\n",
    "```\n",

    "Now we have successfully terminated the underlying query and terminated the stream!\n",
